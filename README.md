# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

On my quest to delve into machine learning, I am using the Titanic dataset as a test bed for implementing new algorithms I learn. The Titanic dataset is a nice beginner dataset and provides an easy and quick method to implement new algorthims.

I still have tonnes and tonnes to learn, both of new algorithms and on the algorithms I have already trialed on this dataset.

##Â Algorithms tried so far:
- A simple gender based model
- Niave Bayes (Implamented using the Sklearn package)
- Support Vector Machines (Implamented using the Sklearn package)
- Decision Trees (Implamented using the Sklearn package)
- Random Forests (Implamented using the Sklearn package)
